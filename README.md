Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning some basic hacking skills and coding skills.

I'm currently working on a small game to teach Dutch people about cancer using information found on the Internet, but if you want to help me with that, I have a repository for that project.

I'm also a student in the Netherlands, so I have a student account.
