Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning some basic hacking skills and coding skills.

I'm currently working on a small game to teach Dutch people about cancer using information found on the Internet, but I have a repository for that project if you want to help me with it.

I'm also a student in the Netherlands, so that's why I have a student account.
